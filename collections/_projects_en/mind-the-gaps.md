Mind the Gaps is an idea which originates both in the fact modern cities face inequality
gaps and the lack of context prevents city services to join their efforts to efficiently
address these gaps. For example in the city of Bristol, women die 12 years earlier in some
neighbourhoods than they might in more prosperous areas, mostly because of an inadequate access
to services and informations.

Minds the Gaps is an open source web visualisation interface which aim at highlighting
major inequality gaps as data narratives by showing where they happen, where the problem-solving
resources are and what is the pathway between them all â€” and their lack of.

Minds the Gaps ambitions is to be showcased in public spaces like the Bristol Data Dome to
decision makers from various city services, communities and charities to acknowledge the
issues, with whom to connect to address them and to effectively engage a dialogue in this
very same space.
